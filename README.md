# Munayfund

Our crowdfunding platform, powered by Arbitrum and Allo Protocol, redefines the
decentralized funding experience. It enables users to create and fund projects
using cryptocurrencies on the Arbitrum network. With a common fund backed by
Allo Protocol, participants vote to decide the fund distribution among projects.
Additionally, it incorporates machine learning for project evaluation, a
user-friendly interface, and robust security in smart contracts, ensuring
transparency and active community participation.
